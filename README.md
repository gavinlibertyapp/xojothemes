Themes for the Xojo IDE

The Xojo IDE allows you to change the colors and font of the code editor in groups (or themes). You might want to have one theme for the daytime and a different one for the evening. 

These themes are compatible with both the Xojo IDE itself and with the confusingly-named XojoThemes (not currently open-sourced but free of cost) which may be of use to you if you change themes regularly. XojoThemes can be downloaded at http://www.libertyapp.com/xojothemes/
